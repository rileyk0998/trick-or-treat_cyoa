# trick-or-treat_cyoa  
cyoa means create your own adventure.  
In this project we were told to create some sort of adventure or story.  
We created an adventure where you choose the paths you want to go on your way to trick-or-treating.  
  
You can try out our adventur by [clicking here](start.md).  
Hope you enjoy it!  
  
This is the [plan](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1v4qJbEc4jCAuaTBWQwKTq9gZkw_JK77jX25KaeQ-2rk/edit?ts=5bd9ad2b) we came up with when deciding what to make.
